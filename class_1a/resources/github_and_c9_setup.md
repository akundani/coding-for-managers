# Github and C9 Setup

### Initial Setup
We'll need to setup our dev environment before we git started (pun intended).

* [Github](https://github.com)
* [Cloud9](https://c9.io)

### A Very, Very Brief Intro to Git

* Visit https://github.com/weilandia/ps-html-basics
* Fork the repo
* Setup our first workspaces

### IDE/CLI
An Integrated Development Environment (IDE) is program that combines several tools a software developer needs into one place. An IDE usually acts as a text editor, a debugger and a compiler. The IDE we are going to use in this class is called Cloud 9. With this tool you will be able to write code and directly execute it online without ever putting anything on your own computer.

  * Command Line (CLI)
  * Server
  * Browser

* Comfort with the development environment is SUPER important for me (and I think most devs). Some companies require everyone to have similar setups and use similar tools and shortcuts, while others leave it up to the developer.
