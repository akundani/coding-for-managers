### Course Tips

Some good rules of thumbs to remember during the class are:

**Google when you don't know**
No software engineers have everything in mind when they are coding. Google is a very powerful resource to find what you are looking for.

**Ask as many questions as you like**
Don't be afraid to ask questions during class. If you don't understand something, you will most likely not be alone in that case. Don't hesitate to raise you hand and ask.
