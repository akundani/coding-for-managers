# CLI Basics

* For every workspace we create, we are going to ry to have a consistent format that will allow us to have a log of everything we've done by the end of the course. This will make sense once we put it into action (and learn a bit more about git), but for now let's do a few things together:

  * Move into the folder called 'SMCOD6'
  * Create a folder named after your GitHub username
  * Move into that folder
  * Print the working directory
  * Move back to the root of the workspace
  * Run this command 'man cp'
  * Copy the 'scavenger_hunt' directory into your directory

* Unix/Linux

* Shell/Bash Commands
  * `ls` (`-t`, `-a`)
  * `pwd`
  * `man`
  * `mkdir`
  * `cd`
  * `touch`
  * `mv`
  * `rm`
  * `rm -f`
