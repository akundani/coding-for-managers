### Course Tips

Some good rules of thumbs to remember during the class are:

**Google when you don't know**
Software engineers Google stuff All The Time. Stack Overflow is your friend.

**Re: Google**
Do not copy/paste code. Typing out code is a great way to learn and build syntax memory.

**Never write a piece of code you don't understand**
If you are using a code snippet you see from docs or Stack Overflow or class, always understand it before accepting it as part of your application.

**Ask as many questions as you like**
Don't be afraid to ask questions during class. If you don't understand something, you will most likely not be alone.
